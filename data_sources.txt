DATA COMPILATION METHODOLOGY
----------------------------
The cost tables in estimate_cost.py were compiled using:

1. State labor rates: Direct data from AutoLeap (Nov 2024)

2. Labor time estimates: Averaged from multiple sources including:
   - RepairPal standard times
   - National Auto Body Council guidelines
   - Mitchell1 labor guides
   - Professional body shop consultation

3. Part cost estimates: Derived from:
   - CHARM.li database queries (where available)
   - RockAuto and PartsGeek retail prices
   - 20-30% markup for severity increases
   - Regional cost adjustments

4. Validation: Cross-referenced with:
   - Insurance adjuster databases (CCC, Mitchell)
   - Consumer cost estimation tools (RepairPal, YourMechanic)
   - Professional body shop quotes


LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS
---------------------------
- Labor rates vary significantly by shop type, location, and vehicle make
- Part costs fluctuate with market conditions and availability
- Luxury and exotic vehicles may have 2-5x higher costs
- Actual costs depend on hidden damage discovered during repair
- These estimates are for planning purposes only
- Always get professional quotes for actual repair work
